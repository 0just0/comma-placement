# Comma placement tool

Project goal is to create a usable tool to restore comma marks(`,`) in texts that do not contain them by mistake or on purpose.

This repo provides the training code for LoRa RoBerta model and some handy scripts to execute it from CLI or to pack in fully-functional microservice inside the Docker container.

## How to use it

### Install

Some steps

### Use from CLI

### Create a web-server


## Idea

This problem can be approached as a token classification task. The idea is to train a transformer model on some text pairs using any relevant dataset from open-source(Wikitext?), remove commas from training examples and keep them for targets.
